# Harbour release: rebuild and restart the full local stack (server + runner).
#
# Why: `next start` reads the build manifest at startup and doesn't watch .next/.
# Rebuilding in place while the old server runs produces stale-chunk 404s/500s
# until the process is restarted. Stopping before the build avoids that window
# entirely (launchd's KeepAlive would otherwise respawn the server mid-build).
# The agent-runner is restarted too so it picks up any changes under bin/.
#
# Currently macOS/launchd only. Extend for Linux/systemd when that install path
# lands in bin/lib/install.mjs.
