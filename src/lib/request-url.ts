 * Build the public base URL from an incoming request.

 * When Harbour sits behind a reverse proxy (Tailscale Serve, Cloudflare,
 * nginx, etc.) `req.nextUrl.host` reflects the internal upstream
 * (`localhost:3000`), not the user-facing hostname. That makes any
 * absolute URLs we bake into API responses — attachment download URLs,
 * agent endpoint URLs — unreachable from the user's browser.
 *
 * Respect `X-Forwarded-Host` / `X-Forwarded-Proto` when present, and
 * fall back to `req.nextUrl` otherwise. If multiple values are chained
 * (comma-separated), use the first (leftmost) entry — that's the
 * original client-facing host.
