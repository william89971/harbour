# Harbour

A control plane for AI agents doing ongoing work.

![Harbour Dashboard](public/screenshot.png)

## Why

AI agents can handle real, ongoing responsibilities — marketing, support, dev. They post content, triage tickets, manage campaigns, submit PRs. Most of this runs on recurring schedules.

The problem is visibility. What jobs does each agent have? What ran today? What needs my attention? What broke?

Harbour is the layer underneath your agents — managing what recurring work each has, giving them shared context through docs and data, and surfacing the things that need you.

## How It Works

Harbour is a polling-based control plane. It never calls out to agents — they pull work on their own schedule.

**Jobs** are recurring responsibilities with a schedule, instructions, and references to docs, data, and env vars. When a job fires, it creates a **run**. Jobs come in two flavors: **agent jobs** where an AI agent does the work, and **workflow jobs** where a shell command handles everything — no LLM involved. A job can also combine both: a workflow runs first as a gate, and the agent only fires if the workflow exits successfully. Agents poll for runs, do the work, post updates, and set a final status — or set it to **waiting** if they need human input.

**Docs** are shared markdown documents (brand guidelines, processes, strategy) injected into runs automatically. **Databases** are SQLite tables agents create and manage through the API, also injected into runs. **Env Vars** are encrypted key-value pairs (API keys, tokens) decrypted and injected at runtime.

### The `/next` Endpoints

Agent jobs are discovered through `GET /api/agents/:id/next`. The response bundles everything: run context, job instructions, docs, database rows, env vars, and an `api` section with pre-resolved endpoints and status options for the run. Agents use `?peek=true` to check for work without claiming it.

Workflow-only jobs that have no agent are discovered through `GET /api/workflows/next`. The harbour runner polls both endpoints automatically.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geekforbrains/harbour.git
cd harbour
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Harbour Agents

Built-in support for running agents via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). A local runner polls for work, spawns your CLI tool, streams output to the dashboard, and posts the result as run activity.

1. Dashboard → **New Agent** → select **Harbour Agent** and pick your CLI tool
2. Name it, pick a model and thinking/effort level, create a job with a schedule and instructions
3. Install the runner:

```bash
npm run harbour -- agent install
```

The runner polls every 60 seconds. All configured agents and agentless workflow jobs run concurrently. Logs go to `~/.harbour/runner.log`.

```bash
npm run harbour -- agent list        # show configured agents
npm run harbour -- agent run         # manual poll (useful for testing)
npm run harbour -- agent uninstall   # stop the runner
```

The runner injects the Harbour API credentials and endpoints into each prompt, so harbour agents can set run status (`done`, `waiting`, `failed`), post activity messages, and manage docs and databases — just like external agents. If an agent doesn't set a final status, the runner marks the run as failed. Stuck or misdirected runs can be killed from the dashboard — comment on a killed run to resume the CLI session where it left off.

Model and thinking/effort levels can be set per agent (default) and overridden per job — letting you use a lighter model for routine tasks and a heavier one for complex work.

### External Agents

Any tool that can poll an HTTP endpoint works — [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), custom scripts, or any agent framework.

1. Dashboard → **New Agent** → select **External** to get an API key
2. Create a job with a schedule and instructions
3. Copy the invite text into your agent's system prompt

The invite includes credentials and the polling loop. The `/next` endpoint provides everything the agent needs, including the API reference for the current run.

## Admin API Keys

Admin API keys give external agents full management access to Harbour — creating agents, jobs, runs, docs, databases, env vars, and modifying settings. This is how you let a separate AI assistant help you operate Harbour remotely.

1. Dashboard → **Settings** → **Admin API Keys** → **New Key**
2. Name it, copy the invite text (includes key, URL, and bootstrap instructions)
3. Paste the invite into your management agent's conversation

The invite tells the agent to fetch `GET /api/admin-guide` with its key, which returns the full admin API reference. Admin keys resolve to the creating user's identity for audit trails.

Admin API documentation is served at `/api/admin-guide` and maintained in [ADMIN_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_GUIDE.md).

## Agent API

```
GET  /api/agents/:id/next           — get next agent run (or nothing)
GET  /api/agents/:id/next?peek=true — check for work without claiming it
GET  /api/workflows/next            — get next agentless workflow run (runner only)
POST /api/jobs                      — create a workflow-only job (no agent)
PUT  /api/runs/:id/status           — update run status
POST /api/runs/:id/activity         — add to the run's activity log
POST /api/runs/:id/retry            — retry a failed/skipped/killed run
POST /api/runs/:id/kill             — kill a running harbour-agent run
DELETE /api/runs/:id                — delete a run and its attachments
POST /api/runs/:id/attachments      — upload a file (multipart) or attach a video embed URL (JSON)
GET  /api/runs/:id/attachments/:aid/file — download an uploaded file
POST /api/docs                      — create a doc
PUT  /api/docs/:id                  — update a doc
POST /api/databases                 — create a database
POST /api/databases/:id/rows        — insert rows
GET  /api/databases/:id/rows        — read rows (paginated)
GET  /api/guide                     — full API guide
```

Full API documentation is served at `/api/guide` and maintained in [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md).

## Run Lifecycle

```
scheduled → running → done
                    → failed
                    → killed (harbour agent stopped mid-run)
                    → skipped (workflow determined nothing to do)
                    → waiting (needs human) → pending (human responded) → running → ...
```

Failed, skipped, and killed runs can be retried from the dashboard — the run goes back to `pending` and the agent picks it up on next poll. Killed runs can also be resumed via comment, continuing the CLI session where it left off.

## Workflows

Workflows bring deterministic, shell-based execution to Harbour jobs. A workflow is a shell command that the runner executes locally — either as a pre-step before the AI agent, or as the entire job with no AI involved.

**Three execution modes:**

| Mode | Config | What happens |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Agent only | No workflow command | Agent runs as normal |
| Workflow + Agent | Workflow command, workflow_only off | Workflow runs first as a gate. Exit 0 = agent runs with stdout as context. Exit 77 = skip. Other = fail. |
| Workflow only | Workflow command, workflow_only on | Workflow is the entire job. No agent, no LLM. Exit 0 = done. Exit 77 = skip. Other = fail. |

Workflow-only jobs don't require an agent — they're standalone scheduled commands. The runner receives the full run payload (JSON) on stdin and executes the command with `~/.harbour/workflows/` as the working directory.

```bash
# Example: workflow-only job that checks an API
# workflow_command: python3 check_health.py
# Receives run payload on stdin, prints result to stdout
```

## Projects

Projects are an optional way to organize your work. They're a view layer — a bag of references to agents, jobs, docs, env vars, and databases. They don't own anything; entities live at the top level and can belong to multiple projects (or none).

- Create projects from the sidebar dropdown (desktop) or the header (mobile)
- Switch between projects to filter all pages, or view "All Projects" to see everything
- When viewing a project, "Add Existing" buttons let you attach existing items
- Creating new items while in a project auto-links them
- Adding a job to a project auto-links its agent, docs, env vars, and databases
- Manage projects (rename, delete) in Settings while viewing a project
- Deleting a project only removes the grouping — nothing else is affected

## Dashboard

- **Runs** — running, scheduled, waiting, pending, and recent runs. Create one-off runs or recurring jobs from a unified dialog.
- **Jobs** — split into Agent Jobs and Workflow Jobs. Shows run/skip counts, schedules, and linked docs/env vars.
- **Agents** — list of agents with jobs, activity, and poll status. Harbour agents show CLI tool, model, and thinking level.
- **Docs** — shared knowledge base, editable by humans and agents. Pin docs to auto-attach to all new jobs.
- **Databases** — read-only view of agent-managed SQLite tables.
- **Env Vars** — encrypted variables (API keys, tokens) injected at runtime. Pin to auto-attach to all new jobs.
- **Settings** — system timezone, signup control, project management, and admin API keys.
